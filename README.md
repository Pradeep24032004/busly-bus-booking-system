# 🚍 Busly – Bus Booking System  

A full-stack bus booking application built with **FastAPI (Python)**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js**, implementing **concurrent seat reservation with multithreading, locks, and synchronization** to ensure **atomic bookings and cancellations**.  

This project demonstrates **real-world system design concepts** such as **concurrency control, authentication, role-based access, and revenue tracking**.

## 🧵 Concurrency & Threading – The Core Innovation  

The **heart of the system** lies in **seat reservation handling**. Multiple users may attempt to book the same seat **simultaneously**. To avoid **double booking**, we implemented a **thread-safe locking mechanism**:  

- **Shared Resource**: Each seat of a bus is treated as a **shared resource**.  
- **Lock Acquisition**:  
  - When a user selects a seat, the system attempts to **acquire a lock** on that seat.  
  - If the seat is already locked by another transaction, booking fails with a **conflict**.  
- **Atomic Reservation**:  
  - Either all selected seats are locked successfully → booking confirmed.  
  - Or if any conflict arises → rollback & release previously locked seats.  
- **Lock Release**:  
  - Once a booking is confirmed or cancelled, the lock is released back into the pool.  

👉 **Why is this important?**  
Without locks, two users could **simultaneously book the same seat**, leading to **data inconsistency** and financial disputes. By using **threading + locking**, we guarantee **100% atomicity** and **isolation** of seat booking operations.

Here User 1 is trying to book seat 18 and User 2 sees that is being reserved. It involves threads no two users cannot book same seat simultaneously.

### 🔒 Pseudo Workflow of Locking  

```plaintext
User selects seats → Try to acquire locks
    If all locks acquired:
        Reserve seats
        Deduct wallet balance
    Else:
        Release acquired locks
        Return "Seats already booked"
